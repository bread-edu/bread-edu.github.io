		    The <strong>universe</strong> is the set of all physical things. Therefore, physics is the study of all physical things. Because "physical things" is too long of a name, "things" will just refer to "physical things" from now on. The study of non-physical things is typically called <strong>philosophy</strong>.
		</p><p>
		    Physics is a natural science, whose ultimate goal is to create the <strong>theory of everything</strong>, a theory which, well, describes everything.
		</p><p>
		    There are two approaches to physics: <strong>theoretical</strong> and <strong>experimental</strong>. Neither of these approaches are better than or worse than the other; both of them are necessary for advancing physics.

			<strong>Mechanics</strong> is the study of motion.
		</p><p>
			There are some big words like "kinematics", "dynamics", "statics" that I will ignore, because they don't really contribute to learning.
		</p><p>
			Instead, I'll choose to study five different types of motion: things that move in a straight line (<strong>linear motion</strong>), things that don't (<strong>nonlinear / curvilinear motion</strong>), things that rotate or spin (<strong>rotational motion</strong>), things that move back and forth (<strong>periodic / oscillatory motion</strong>), and things that move randomly (<strong>random / fluid motion</strong>).

			The <strong>universe</strong> is the set of all physical things.
		</p><p>
			The <strong>system</strong> is the part of the universe that we choose to care about, and the <strong>surroundings</strong> are everything else.
		</p><p>
			A <strong>closed</strong> or <strong>isolated</strong> system is one that does not interact with the surroundings, as opposed to an <strong>open</strong> system. We'll assume that most systems are closed, even though that's not how real life works, because we like to make idealistic assumptions.
		</p><p>
			For the things in our system, there are three fundamental characteristics that we care about in this unit: <strong>matter</strong>, <strong>space</strong>, and <strong>time</strong>.
		</p><p>
			Things are made up of matter, which is, well, what things are made up of (no s*** Sherlock).
		</p><p>
			Things exist in space, which is the container in which things exist (ignoring the philosophy and existential questions).
		</p><p>
			Things change over time, which is the basis which we measure change against (again, ignoring existential questions that keep you up in the middle of the night).
		</p><p>
			Now that's cool and all, but we need some other way to describe these characteristics in order to study them. Fortunately (or unfortunately), we use math to represent these characteristics in terms of quantities with units.
		</p><p>
			<strong>Units</strong> (or dimensions) tell you what type of characteristic the quantity describes, as well as the relationship between different types of quantities. The units for matter, space, and time are typically <strong>kilograms</strong> (kg), <strong>meters</strong> (m), and <strong>seconds</strong> (s) respectively.
		</p><p>
			<strong>Quantities</strong> are the actual values, and are either <strong>scalars</strong> or <a href = "/math.html#structure_linear-algebra_vector-spaces"><strong>vectors</strong></a>. In terms of physics, scalars simply represent magnitudes, whereas vectors represent magnitudes with directions.
		</p><p>
			The quantities for matter, space, and time are respectively <strong>mass</strong> (m), <strong>position</strong>, and <strong>time</strong> (really creative on that last one, I know).
		</p><p>
			Mass is a nonnegative scalar which measures
