					Music, in an abstract sense, is the duality of <strong>sound</strong> and <strong>silence</strong>.
				</p><p>
					Sound and silence form a duality of existence and nonexistence, of change and invariance, each the inverse of the other and each the definition of the other.
				</p><p>
					Sound is defined by silence, as sound requires silence to distinguish its ideas; silence is meaningful in its emptiness and absence, which allows for ponderance and interpretation.
				</p><p>
					Silence is defined by sound, as silence without sound is empty without meaning; sound is meaningful in its change and complexities, which allows for expression.
				</p><p>
					Each without its complement, either sound or silence eventually grows overwhelmingly repetitive and meaningless.
