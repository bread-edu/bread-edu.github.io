					Music, in a general sense, is a fundamental language for expression.
				</p><p>
					Music is fundamental in its <strong>universality</strong>. All humans and potentially all life are capable of the expression and interpretation of music; even those with hearing impairment may appreciate music through the touch or feel of vibrations, which is essentially linked to the sense of hearing.
				</p><p>
					Music is fundamental in its <strong>generality</strong>. As the duality of sound and silence, music is the generalization of all spoken human languages, of the auditory languages of other life, and of the overall perception of periodic motion, which encompasses the senses of hearing and feeling.
				</p><p>
					Music is fundamental in its <strong>expressiveness</strong>. The infinite diversity in musical expression is a natural result of the diversity in all forms of expression; music is capable of expressing a diversity of emotions, qualities, and ideas that other arts and languages cannot.
				</p><p>
					Music is fundamental in its <strong>freedom</strong>. Music is defined solely by the existence of the creator’s intent to express or the listener’s intent to interpret, so no combination of sound and silence may be denied as music, as no one can know whether someone else may genuinely express or interpret any given music.
