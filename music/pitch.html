			<strong>Frequency</strong> is the description of individual waves.<br>
			<strong>Intervals</strong> are the relationships between frequencies.
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<h4>Frequency and intervals</h4>
			<p>
				Individual frequencies make no impact on the quality of music.
			</p><p>
				Intervals, in contrast, determine the qualities of music
			</p>

		<p>
			The typical range of human hearing 
		</p>
		Pitch classes and octaves (Therefore, the frequential axis should not be linear, but rather a logarithmic 
		log_2(f / 20), from 0 to 10
		Units of frequency and divisions of the octabe
		Consonance and dissonance (resolution and tension, rest and motion)
		Melody and harmony

		<h2 id = "tuning_and_temperament">1.2 <a href = "#">pitch</a> &#62; tuning and temperament</h2>

			<strong>Tuning</strong> is the musical description of frequency.<br>
			<strong>Temperament</strong> is the musical description of intervals.

		<h2 id = "scales_and_modes">1.3 <a href = "#">pitch</a> &#62; scales and modes</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>Scales</strong> are collections of pitches.<br>
			<strong>Modes</strong> are collections of pitches coupled with their melodic and harmonic characteristics.
		</p>

		<h2 id = "melodic_lines">1.4 <a href = "#">pitch</a> &#62; melodic lines</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>Melodic lines</strong> are collections of pitches with motion primarily through the temporal axis.

		<h2 id = "harmonic_sets">1.5 <a href = "#">pitch</a> &#62; harmonic sets</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>Harmonic sets</strong> are collections of pitches with motion primarily through the frequential axis.
		</p>

		<h2 id = "functional_harmony">1.6 <a href = "#">pitch</a> &#62; functional harmony</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>Functional harmony</strong> is the description of harmony as functional relations between harmonic sets.

		<h2 id = "expressive_harmony">1.7 <a href = "#">pitch</a> &#62; expressive harmony</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>Expressive harmony</strong> is the description of harmony as the expressive qualities of harmonic sets.
