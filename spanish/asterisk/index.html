			<h1>∗</h1>
			<p>
				Let <strong>∗</strong> be the fundamental language for expression.
			</p><p>
				<strong>Expression</strong> (<span lang = "es">la expresión</span>) is the manifestation of the <strong>universal human experience</strong>; human languages like music and Spanish are then merely partial aspects of ∗, expressed through experiences like hearing or sight.
			</p><p>
				<strong>Spanish</strong> (<span lang = "es">español</span>) is an expressive language and collective identity.
			</p><p>
				As a human language, Spanish is expressed through <strong>speech</strong> and <strong>writing</strong> (<span lang = "es">el habla y la escritura</span>) and learned through <strong>practice</strong> and <strong>immersion</strong> (<span lang = "es">la práctica y la inmersión</span>).
			</p><p>
				As a collective identity, Spanish is the fourth most-spoken language globally, encompassing the expression of over half a billion speakers in over 25 countries.
			</p><p>
				The following material is intended for the process of learning Spanish from English, which is unique in its ease and interestingness due to the similarities between the two languages.
			</p><p>
				The following material will cover basic elements of Spanish (a common variant of United States Spanish), but not advanced elements, linguistic variants, or the literature, history, and culture of Spanish-speaking countries.
