		<h3>Capitalization</h3>
		<p>
			Spanish letters can be <strong>uppercase</strong> (<span lang = "es">mayúscula</span>) or <strong>lowercase</strong> (<span lang = "es">minúscula</span>), just as in English.
		</p>
		<section>
			<p>
				In general, Spanish capitalization is infrequent compared to English.
			</p><p>
				If a word is capitalized in Spanish, its counterpart is also capitalized in English (the only exceptions are <span lang = "es">Sol</span> and <span lang = "es">Luna</span> for sun and moon), but the reverse is not necessarily true.
			</p>
		</section>
		<p>
			The following are capitalized in both Spanish and English:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The first letter of every sentence</li>
			<li>The first letter of proper nouns</li>
			<li>The common abbreviations of personal titles (and the full personal titles of <span lang = "es">Don</span> and <span lang = "es">Doña</span>)</li>
			<li>The first letter of titles of books, movies, and other works</li>
			<li>The first letter of every word in titles of newspapers and magazines</li>
			<li>The names of religious festivals and national holidays</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The following are capitalized not in Spanish, but in English:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Languages, nationalities, and geographical features</li>
			<li>Words derived from the names of cities and countries</li>
			<li>Full personal titles</li>
			<li>Ordinal numbers following a name</li>
			<li>Days of the week and months of the year</li>
			<li>Religions and their adherents</li>
		</ul>
