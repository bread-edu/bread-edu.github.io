		<p>
			<strong>Spanish</strong> (<span lang = "es">español</span>) is a language for human expression.
		</p><p>
			Spanish is one of the most commonly used languages in the world; thus, learning Spanish greatly expands one’s ability of communication and expression.
		</p><p>
			Generally, <strong>languages</strong> (<span lang = "es">las lenguas</span>) are systems of communication and expression with four elements: listening, reading, speaking, and writing, which are learned through a combination of <strong>practice</strong> (<span lang = "es">práctica</span>) and <strong>immersion</strong> (<span lang = "es">inmersión</span>).
		</p><p>
			Specifically, learning Spanish as an English speaker is an interesting and rather easy process, because Spanish and English are two of the most similar languages despite belonging to different families.
		</p><p>
			This course is written for English speakers learning Spanish, covering basic elements of Spanish (a variant of Latin American Spanish taught in some schools in the United States); it will not cover advanced elements, linguistic variants, or the literature, history, and culture of Spanish-speaking countries.
		</p>

		<h2 id = "units">1 <a href = "#">spanish</a> &#62; units</h2>
		<p><strong>Units</strong> (<span lang = "es">las unidades</span>) are the smallest elements of language.</p>

		<h3 id = "units-phonemes_and_graphemes">1.0 <a href = "#units">units</a> &#62; phonemes and graphemes</h3>
		<p>
			<strong>Phonemes</strong> (<span lang = "es">los fonemas</span>) are the units of spoken language, represented as /phonemes/.<br>
			<br>
			- <strong>Vowels</strong> (<span lang = "es">las vocales</span>) are phonemes which pronounced without any stricture in the vocal tract.<br>
			- <strong>Consonants</strong> (<span lang = "es">las consonantes</span>) are phonemes pronounced with complete or partial closure of the vocal tract.
		</p><p>
			<strong>Graphemes</strong> (<span lang = "es">los grafemas</span>) are the units of written language, represented as ⟨graphemes⟩.
			<br>
			- <strong>Letters</strong> (<span lang = "es">las letras</span>) are graphemes which are organized to form words.<br>
			- <strong>Diacritics</strong> (<span lang = "es">los diacríticos</span>) are graphemes which slightly modify letters.<br>
			- <strong>Digits</strong> (<span lang = "es">los dígitos</span>) are graphemes which are organized to form numbers.<br>
			- <strong>Punctuation</strong> (<span lang = "es">la puntuación</span>) is the set of graphemes which separates or connects words and sentences to clarify the meaning of or indicate the qualities of text.<br>
			- <strong>Keyboard symbols</strong> (<span lang = "es">los símbolos de teclado</span>) include graphemes found universally on keyboards, which are commonly used in math and computing or as substitutions.<br>
			- <strong>Especial symbols</strong> (<span lang = "es">los símbolos especiales</span>) include graphemes unique to Spanish-speaking countries, which commonly indicate currencies or abbreviations.
		</p><p>
			<strong>Grapheme-phoneme correspondence</strong> (<span lang = "es">la correspondencia grafema-fonema</span>) is the relationship between graphemes and phonemes; in general, graphemes correspond to their represented phonemes more consistently in Spanish.<br>
			<br>
			- Letters correspond to phonemes.<br>
			- <strong>Unigraphs</strong> (<span lang = "es">los unigrafos</span>) are single letters which correspond to a single phoneme; with letters in Spanish, there are only slight, regular deviations from one-to-one correspondence with phonemes.<br>
			- <strong>Multigraphs</strong> (<span lang = "es">los multigrafos</span>) are groups of letters which correspond to a single phoneme; the only multigraphs in Spanish are five digraphs.<br>
			- Diacritics correspond to slight modifications of a phoneme.<br>
			- Numbers and digits correspond to their names.<br>
			- Punctuation corresponds to different durations of silences or changes in speed or tone.<br>
			- Keyboard symbols correspond to their names or functions (when used in math and computing) or their meanings (when used as substitutions).<br>
			- Especial symbols correspond to the names of their represented currencies or the meanings of their abbreviations.

		<h3 id = "units-letters">1.1 <a href = "#units">units</a> &#62; letters</h3>
		<p>
			The <strong>alphabet</strong> (<span lang = "es">el alfabeto</span>) is the set of all basic letters.
		</p><p>
			The Spanish alphabet contains 27 letters, including a-z from the English alphabet and the additional letter <span lang = "es">ñ</span>.
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<h4>Capitalization rules (<span lang = "es">las reglas de capitalización</span>)</h4>
			<p>
				Spanish letters can be <strong>uppercase</strong> (<span lang = "es">mayúscula</span>) or <strong>lowercase</strong> (<span lang = "es">minúscula</span>), just as in English.
			</p><p>
				In general, Spanish capitalization is infrequent compared to English. If a word is capitalized in Spanish, its counterpart is also capitalized in English (the only exceptions are <span lang = "es">Sol</span> and <span lang = "es">Luna</span> for sun and moon), but the reverse is not necessarily true.
			</p><p>
				The following are capitalized in both Spanish and English:<br>
				<br>
				- The first letter of every sentence<br>
				- The first letter of proper nouns (names of people, cities, countries, places, etc.)<br>
				- The common abbreviations of personal titles like <span lang = "es">Sr.</span> (Mr.), <span lang = "es">Sra.</span> (Mrs.), <span lang = "es">Srta.</span> (Ms.), <span lang = "es">D.</span> (Sir), <span lang = "es">Da.</span> (Lady), or <span lang = "es">Dr.</span> (Dr.); the full personal titles of <span lang = "es">Don</span> (Sir) and <span lang = "es">Doña</span> (Lady) may be capitalized as well<br>
				- The first letter of the first word in titles of books, movies, and other works of art<br>
				- The first letter of every word in titles of newspapers and magazines<br>
				- The names of religious festivals and national holidays<br>
			</p><p>
				The following are capitalized not in Spanish, but in English:<br>
				<br>
				- Words derived from the names of cities and countries<br>
				- Geographical features in geographical names<br>
				- Full personal titles like <span lang = "es">señor</span> (Mister), <span lang = "es">señora</span> (Missus), <span lang = "es">señorita</span> (Miss), or <span lang = "es">doctor</span> (Doctor)<br>
				- Ordinal numbers following a name like <span lang = "es">Louis catorce</span> (Louis the Fourteenth)<br>
				- Days of the week and months of the year<br>
				- Languages, nationalities, and names for religions and adherents

			<strong>Diacritics</strong> (<span lang = "es">los diacríticos</span>) are graphemes which slightly modify letters. In both languages, letters with diacritics are not considered separate letters of the alphabet.

		<p>
			<strong>Vowels</strong> (<span lang = "es">las vocales</span>) are phonemes which pronounced without any stricture in the vocal tract.<br>
			<br>
			- <strong>Strong vowels</strong> (<span lang = "es">las vocales fuertes</span>, also open vowels, low vowels, or mid vowels) are phonemes where the tongue is in a low or medium position, away from the roof of the mouth.
			- <strong>Weak vowels</strong> (<span lang = "es">las vocales débiles</span>, also close vowels or high vowels) are phonemes where the tongue is in a high position, as close as possible to the roof of the mouth without creating a constriction.
			- <strong>Semivowels</strong> (<span lang = "es">las semivocales</span>, also semiconsonants or approximants) are phonemes that are pronounced like weak vowels but behave like consonants.
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<h4>Vowel rules (<span lang = "es">las reglas de las vocales</span>)</h4>
			<p>
				Spanish vowel sounds are shorter, crisper, more distinct, and more consistent than English vowels.
			</p><p>
				In English, vowels can be silent and represent more than fourteen different vowel sounds. In particular, the <strong>schwa sound</strong> (<span lang = "es">el sonido schwa</span>, the indistinct /ə/ or “uhh” mid vowel sound) is the most common vowel sound, with any vowel letter being able to stand for the schwa sound.
			</p><p>
				In Spanish, vowels are never silent and represent five distinct vowel sounds, always pronounced consistently in sound and in length. In particular, vowels tend to be pronounced as if opening one’s mouth or showing one’s teeth as much as possible, and the schwa sound characteristic to English is avoided.
			</p><p>

				The u with diaeresis (<span lang = "es">ü</span>) is only used to distinguish between a silent u in gue and gui (/ge/ and /gi/) and a semivowel /w/ sound in güe and güi (/gwe/ and /gwi/).

			- Monophthongs (<span lang = "es">los monoptongos</span>) are constant, pure vowel sounds within a single syllable.<br>
			- Diphthongs (<span lang = "es">los diptongos</span>, or gliding vowels) are combinations of two consecutive vowel sounds within a single syllable.<br>
			- Triphthongs (<span lang = "es">los triptongos</span>) are combinations of three consecutive vowel sounds within a single syllable.<br>
			- Polyphthongs (<span lang = "es">los polifongos</span>) are combinations of any number of consecutive vowel sounds within a single syllable.<br>

			<h4>Consecutive vowels rules (<span lang = "es">las reglas de las vocales consecutivas</span>)</h4>
			<p>
				- Polyphthongs contain at most one strong vowel. Therefore, diphthongs are combinations of two weak vowels or of a strong vowel and a weak vowel, and triphthongs are combinations of a strong vowel between two unaccented weak vowels.
				- Triphthongs and other polyphthongs are rare, including mostly <span lang = "es">⟨iái⟩, ⟨iéi⟩, ⟨uái⟩, ⟨uay⟩, ⟨uau⟩,</span> and <span lang = "es">⟨uey⟩</span>.
			</p><p>
				- Two consecutive strong vowels are always in hiatus, although their sounds may sometimes naturally blend together.
				- Two consecutive weak vowels are very rarely in hiatus.
				- When a strong vowel is next to a weak vowel, an accent on the weak vowel indicates a hiatus, while an accent absent or on the strong vowel indicates a diphthong.

				- ⟨Ll⟩ does not represent a prolonged /l/ sound, nor does ⟨l⟩ represent a shortened /ʝ/ sound; ⟨ll⟩ and ⟨l⟩ should be distinguished in pronunciation.<br>
				- ⟨Qu⟩ is only used in front of ⟨e⟩ or ⟨i⟩; the /k/ sound before ⟨a⟩ or ⟨o⟩ is represented by ⟨c⟩.<br>
				- ⟨Qü⟩ does not exist in Spanish; the /kw/ sound that it might have represented is always represented by ⟨cu⟩.<br>
				- ⟨rr⟩ only occurs between vowels; the trilled /r/ sound is represented by ⟨r⟩ is a variety of other contexts.<br>
				- While the trilled r sound may be difficult for many English speakers, it can in fact be learned and is less important to pronunciation than other factors like avoiding the schwa sound.

			<strong>Pronunciation</strong> (<span lang = "es">la pronunciación</span>) is the set of conventions regarding the organization of phonemes in speech.
		</p><p>
			<strong>Syllables</strong> (<span lang = "es">las sílabas</span>) are the basic elements of pronunciation in words, made up of a nucleus (vowel sounds) and optional boundaries (semivowel or consonant sounds).
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<h4>Stress and accent rules (<span lang = "es">las reglas de acentuación y acentos</span>)</h4>
			<p>
				<strong>Stress</strong> (<span lang = "es">la acentuación</span>), or accent, is the primary suprasegmental feature of syllables, involving emphasis through pitch or dynamics.
			</p><p>
				When the word ends in a vowel, n, or s, the stress naturally falls on the second-to-last syllable.
				When the word ends in a consonant other than n or s, the stress naturally falls on the last syllable.
				When the actual stress is different from the pattern above, an accent is placed on the actual stressed syllable.
			</p><p>
				The accent is always an acute accent, only falls on a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), and occurs at most once per word.
				The accent, when on the actually stressed syllable, indicates the different stress or emphasis.
				The accent, when on the naturally stressed or only syllable, indicates distinction between homonyms.
