			<strong>Spanish</strong> (<span lang = "es">español</span>) is a language for human expression.
		</p><p>
			Spanish is one of the most commonly used languages in the world; thus, learning Spanish greatly expands one’s ability of communication and expression.
		</p><p>
			Generally, <strong>languages</strong> (<span lang = "es">las lenguas</span>) are systems of communication and expression with four elements: listening, reading, speaking, and writing, which are learned through a combination of <strong>practice</strong> (<span lang = "es">práctica</span>) and <strong>immersion</strong> (<span lang = "es">inmersión</span>).
		</p><p>
			Specifically, learning Spanish as an English speaker is an interesting and rather easy process, because Spanish and English are two of the most similar languages despite belonging to different families.
		</p><p>
			This course is written for English speakers learning Spanish, covering basic elements of Spanish (a variant of Latin American Spanish taught in some schools in the United States); it will not cover advanced elements, linguistic variants, or the literature, history, and culture of Spanish-speaking countries.

		<p><strong>Units</strong> (<span lang = "es">las unidades</span>) are the smallest elements of language.</p>

		<h3 id = "units-phonemes_and_graphemes">1.0 <a href = "#units">units</a> &#62; phonemes and graphemes</h3>
		<p>
			<strong>Phonemes</strong> (<span lang = "es">los fonemas</span>) are the units of spoken language, represented as /phonemes/.<br>
			<br>
			- <strong>Vowels</strong> (<span lang = "es">las vocales</span>) are phonemes which pronounced without any stricture in the vocal tract.<br>
			- <strong>Consonants</strong> (<span lang = "es">las consonantes</span>) are phonemes pronounced with complete or partial closure of the vocal tract.
		</p><p>
			<strong>Graphemes</strong> (<span lang = "es">los grafemas</span>) are the units of written language, represented as ⟨graphemes⟩.
			<br>
			- <strong>Letters</strong> (<span lang = "es">las letras</span>) are graphemes which are organized to form words.<br>
			- <strong>Diacritics</strong> (<span lang = "es">los diacríticos</span>) are graphemes which slightly modify letters.<br>
			- <strong>Digits</strong> (<span lang = "es">los dígitos</span>) are graphemes which are organized to form numbers.<br>
			- <strong>Punctuation</strong> (<span lang = "es">la puntuación</span>) is the set of graphemes which separates or connects words and sentences to clarify the meaning of or indicate the qualities of text.<br>
			- <strong>Keyboard symbols</strong> (<span lang = "es">los símbolos de teclado</span>) include graphemes found universally on keyboards, which are commonly used in math and computing or as substitutions.<br>
			- <strong>Especial symbols</strong> (<span lang = "es">los símbolos especiales</span>) include graphemes unique to Spanish-speaking countries, which commonly indicate currencies or abbreviations.
		</p><p>
			<strong>Grapheme-phoneme correspondence</strong> (<span lang = "es">la correspondencia grafema-fonema</span>) is the relationship between graphemes and phonemes; in general, graphemes correspond to their represented phonemes more consistently in Spanish.<br>
			<br>
			- Letters correspond to phonemes.<br>
			- <strong>Unigraphs</strong> (<span lang = "es">los unigrafos</span>) are single letters which correspond to a single phoneme; with letters in Spanish, there are only slight, regular deviations from one-to-one correspondence with phonemes.<br>
			- <strong>Multigraphs</strong> (<span lang = "es">los multigrafos</span>) are groups of letters which correspond to a single phoneme; the only multigraphs in Spanish are five digraphs.<br>
			- Diacritics correspond to slight modifications of a phoneme.<br>
			- Numbers and digits correspond to their names.<br>
			- Punctuation corresponds to different durations of silences or changes in speed or tone.<br>
			- Keyboard symbols correspond to their names or functions (when used in math and computing) or their meanings (when used as substitutions).<br>
			- Especial symbols correspond to the names of their represented currencies or the meanings of their abbreviations.

		<p>
			The <strong>alphabet</strong> (<span lang = "es">el alfabeto</span>) is the set of all basic letters.
		</p><p>
			The Spanish alphabet contains 27 letters, including a-z from the English alphabet and the additional letter <span lang = "es">ñ</span>.

		<blockquote>
			<h4>Capitalization rules (<span lang = "es">las reglas de capitalización</span>)</h4>
			<p>
				Spanish letters can be <strong>uppercase</strong> (<span lang = "es">mayúscula</span>) or <strong>lowercase</strong> (<span lang = "es">minúscula</span>), just as in English.
			</p><p>
				In general, Spanish capitalization is infrequent compared to English. If a word is capitalized in Spanish, its counterpart is also capitalized in English (the only exceptions are <span lang = "es">Sol</span> and <span lang = "es">Luna</span> for sun and moon), but the reverse is not necessarily true.
			</p><p>
				The following are capitalized in both Spanish and English:<br>
				<br>
				- The first letter of every sentence<br>
				- The first letter of proper nouns (names of people, cities, countries, places, etc.)<br>
				- The common abbreviations of personal titles like <span lang = "es">Sr.</span> (Mr.), <span lang = "es">Sra.</span> (Mrs.), <span lang = "es">Srta.</span> (Ms.), <span lang = "es">D.</span> (Sir), <span lang = "es">Da.</span> (Lady), or <span lang = "es">Dr.</span> (Dr.); the full personal titles of <span lang = "es">Don</span> (Sir) and <span lang = "es">Doña</span> (Lady) may be capitalized as well<br>
				- The first letter of the first word in titles of books, movies, and other works of art<br>
				- The first letter of every word in titles of newspapers and magazines<br>
				- The names of religious festivals and national holidays<br>
			</p><p>
				The following are capitalized not in Spanish, but in English:<br>
				<br>
				- Words derived from the names of cities and countries<br>
				- Geographical features in geographical names<br>
				- Full personal titles like <span lang = "es">señor</span> (Mister), <span lang = "es">señora</span> (Missus), <span lang = "es">señorita</span> (Miss), or <span lang = "es">doctor</span> (Doctor)<br>
				- Ordinal numbers following a name like <span lang = "es">Louis catorce</span> (Louis the Fourteenth)<br>
				- Days of the week and months of the year<br>
				- Languages, nationalities, and names for religions and adherents
