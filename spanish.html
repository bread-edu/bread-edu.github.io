			<strong>Spanish</strong> (<span lang = "es">español</span>) is a language for human expression.
		</p><p>
			Spanish is one of the most commonly used languages in the world; thus, learning Spanish greatly expands one’s ability of communication and expression.
		</p><p>
			Generally, <strong>languages</strong> (<span lang = "es">las lenguas</span>) are systems of communication and expression with four elements: listening, reading, speaking, and writing, which are learned through a combination of <strong>practice</strong> (<span lang = "es">práctica</span>) and <strong>immersion</strong> (<span lang = "es">inmersión</span>).
		</p><p>
			Specifically, learning Spanish as an English speaker is an interesting and rather easy process, because Spanish and English are two of the most similar languages despite belonging to different families.
		</p><p>
			This course is written for English speakers learning Spanish, covering basic elements of Spanish (a variant of Latin American Spanish taught in some schools in the United States); it will not cover advanced elements, other variants, or the literature, history, and culture of Spanish-speaking countries.
